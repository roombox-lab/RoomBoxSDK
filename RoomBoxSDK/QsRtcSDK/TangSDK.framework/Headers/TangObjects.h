 Note:

 - The dimension does not specify the orientation mode of the output ratio. For how to set the video orientation, see [TangVideoOutputOrientationMode](TangVideoOutputOrientationMode).
 - Whether 720p can be supported depends on the device. If the device cannot support 720p, the frame rate will be lower than the one listed in the table. Tang optimizes the video in lower-end devices.
 - iPhones do not support video frame dimensions above 720p.

/** The bitrate of the video.

 Sets the video bitrate (Kbps). Refer to the table below and set your bitrate. If you set a bitrate beyond the proper range, the SDK automatically adjusts it to a value within the range. You can also choose from the following options:

 - TangVideoBitrateStandard: (recommended) the standard bitrate mode. In this mode, the bitrates differ between the Live-broadcast and Communication profiles:

     - Communication profile: the video bitrate is the same as the base bitrate.
     - Live-broadcast profile: the video bitrate is twice the base bitrate.

 - TangVideoBitrateCompatible: the compatible bitrate mode. In this mode, the bitrate stays the same regardless of the profile. In the Live-broadcast profile, if you choose this mode, the video frame rate may be lower than the set value.

Tang uses different video codecs for different profiles to optimize the user experience. For example, the Communication profile prioritizes the smoothness while the Live-broadcast profile prioritizes the video quality (a higher bitrate). Therefore, Tang recommends setting this parameter as TangVideoBitrateStandard.
